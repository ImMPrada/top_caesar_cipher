## Caesar cipher

A challenge on [Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher)

"In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar’s cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence." - Wikipedia

This solution contains a MEMORY hash to store the ciphered value of a letter, in order to return fast when it is a repeated letter on the string

enjoy!
